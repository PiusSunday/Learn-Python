## To print a line in python, use the print directive

# print a string in python
print("Hello Sunny!")


## Python uses idententation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard identation requires staandard code to use FOUR SPACES. 

# exp.
x = 1
if x == 1:
    # idented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")
