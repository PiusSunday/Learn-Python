## Expression Statements

# Expression statements are statements that do not contain any executable code. They are used to execute an expression.

# An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A single value all by itself is considered an expression. Following are all legal expressions (assuming that the variable x has been assigned a value):

x = 1
5
x
x + 20

# exp

x = 5
# right hand side of = is a expression statement

# x = x + 10 is a complete statement
x = x + 10
