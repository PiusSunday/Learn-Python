## Python Statements

# A statement is an instruction that a Python interpreter can execute. So, in simple words, we can say anything written in Python is a statement.

# Python statement ends with the token NEWLINE character. It means each line in a Python script is a statement.

# example:

a = 10

# a = 10, is an assignment statement. where a is a variable name and 10 is its value. There are other kinds of statements such as if statement, for statement, while statement, etc.



## TYPES OF PYTHON STATEMENTS

# There are mainly four types of statements in Python, print statements, Assignment statements, Conditional statements, Looping statements.


## PRINT STATEMENTS

# Print statements are used to display the output to the user.

## ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS

# Assignment statements are used to assign a value to a variable. 

# Assignment statements donâ€™t produce a result it just assigns a value to the operand on its left side.



## We can add multiple statements on a single line separated by semicolons, as follows:

# two statements in a single
l = 10; b = 5

# statement 3
print('Area of rectangle:', l * b)

# Output Area of rectangle: 50
