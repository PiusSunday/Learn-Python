'''
    We can use the following two ways to get the list of keywords in Python
'''

''' 1. keyword module: The keyword is the buil-in module to get the list of keywords. Also, this module allows a Python program to determine if a string is a keyword. '''

# example:
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

''' 2. help() function: Apart from a keyword module, we can use the help() function to get the list of keywords '''

# example:
print(help("keywords"))



'''NOTE!!!'''

## You cannot use any of the above keywords as identifiers in your programs. If you try to do so, you will get an error. An identifier is a name given to an entity, For example, variables name, functions name, or class name.
