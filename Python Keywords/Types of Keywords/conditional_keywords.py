'''Conditional Keywords: "if", "elif", "else"'''


'''In Python, condition keywords act depending on whether a given condition is true or false. You can execute different blocks of codes depending on the outcome of a condition.'''

# example:

x = 75
if x > 100:
    print('x is greater than 100')
elif x > 50:
    print('x is greater than 50 but less than 100')
else:
    print('x is less than 50')
