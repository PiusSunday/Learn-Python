COMMENTS IN PYTHON
'''

'''
    The comments are descriptions that help programmers to understand the functionality of the program. Thus, comments are necessary while writing code in Python.

In Python, we use the hash (#) symbol to start writing a comment. The comment begins with a hash sign (#) and whitespace character and continues to the end of the line.
